Phase 1: Project Initialization and Basic File Structure
Goal: Set up the project structure, a basic server, and a static HTML file.

Ticket: Set up the project folder and initialize the main file structure.

Terminal:

mkdir tea-roulette
cd tea-roulette
npm init -y
npm install express
mkdir public
touch public/index.html server.js
Ticket: Create a basic HTML template and set up an Express server.

Code a simple server.js to start the server.
Terminal:

node server.js
Output: Verify the server is running at http://localhost:3000.
Ticket: Integrate a design framework (e.g., Bootstrap) for UI and CSS.

Terminal:

npm install bootstrap
Phase 2: Static Page Design and Basic UI
Goal: Set up a static HTML page with the initial UI for tea preference input.

Ticket: Design core UI components on index.html (Tea Preferences List, Spinner Wheel, Tea-Maker Display, Add New Person Modal).

Ticket: Create a CSS file (style.css) for basic styling, including spinner animations.

Terminal:

touch public/style.css
Ticket: Implement minimal CSS and JavaScript to enable a functional form as per Progressive Enhancement principles.

Set up initial add and remove functions for the form.
Phase 3: Backend API Development
Goal: Develop a CRUD API to handle tea preferences and introduce dynamic content.

Ticket: Set up GET /api/preferences API to retrieve the list of current preferences.

Ticket: Create POST /api/preferences API to add a new person’s preferences as JSON data.

Ticket: Add DELETE /api/preferences/all and DELETE /api/preferences/:index endpoints.

Terminal:

touch public/data.json # JSON file for storing preference data
Ticket: Implement ensureDataFile function in server.js to check for data file existence.

Phase 4: Dynamic Content and JavaScript Enhancement
Goal: Add JavaScript to dynamically load and display content, enhancing the form’s functionality.

Ticket: Set up a script.js file to dynamically populate and update the list of preferences using API.

Terminal:

touch public/script.js
Ticket: Implement JavaScript functions to handle list updates and the addition of new people.

Ticket: Retrieve JSON data via API and display it on the page.

Phase 5: Spinner Animation and User Interaction
Goal: Add spinner animation and display the selected person using JavaScript for better user engagement.

Ticket: Integrate spin animation for the spinBtn and control it with JavaScript.

Ticket: Display the selected tea maker on screen after the spin is complete.

Ticket: Add JavaScript controls to disable the spinBtn while the wheel is spinning.

Phase 6: Advanced Error Handling and Notifications
Goal: Enhance error handling and user notifications to create a consistent experience.

Ticket: Improve error handling in showError function to display user-friendly error messages on failures.

Ticket: Add notification messages when a new person is successfully added via the API.

Phase 7: Testing and Performance Enhancements
Goal: Conduct final tests, address bugs, and optimize performance.

Ticket: Test all components and endpoints, ensuring the spinner and database updates function correctly.

Ticket: Create a README.md with all necessary terminal commands and project instructions.

Ticket: Perform final code cleanup by removing unnecessary code and logs.

Phase 8: Deployment and Final Documentation
Goal: Deploy the project and complete all documentation for team and user reference.
